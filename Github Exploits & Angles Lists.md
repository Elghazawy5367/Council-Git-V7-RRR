You are right. I stopped too early. The "Advanced Metrics" in the final tabs (7-13) are critical for your "Night Vision" strategy.  
Here is the complete, re-extracted list of 33 Strategies & Exploits found in the document, including the hidden "Advanced Metrics" from the final section.

# Tab 4

You are right. Complex APIs, tokens, and bans are a headache.  
We will strip this down to the absolute simplest method that runs entirely inside GitHub.  
To see "Trends & Virals" on X, Facebook, and Instagram without logging in, we will use "The Search Engine Backdoor."  
Google indexes X and Instagram. We will ask Google: "Show me the most discussed topics on X/Instagram from the last 24 hours."  
Here is the "Viral Radar" – a single script for your Council that finds marketing gold without touching a social media API.  
The Strategy: "The Dork Scout"  
We use "Google Dorks" (advanced search operators) via your Phantom Scraper (Puppeteer) to extract viral hits.  
 \* For X: We search for "Threads" (which go viral) in your niche.  
 \* For Instagram: We search for "Reels" with high keyword density.  
 \* For Trends: We read the Google Trends RSS (which is open and free).  
The Code: src/viral-radar.ts  
Create this file. It requires puppeteer and rss-parser (standard, easy packages).  
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';  
import Parser from 'rss-parser';

// 1\. Setup: The Niche you are watching  
const NICHE \= "AI Marketing";   
const parser \= new Parser();

async function launchViralRadar() {  
  console.log("📡 Viral Radar Activated...");  
    
  const browser \= await puppeteer.launch({ headless: "new" });  
  const page \= await browser.newPage();

  // \--- JOB 1: THE X (TWITTER) THREAD HUNTER \---  
  // Strategy: Viral value is usually in "Threads" (long form).   
  // We search Google for X.com threads in your niche from the last 24h.  
  console.log("🐦 Scanning X for Viral Threads...");  
    
  // Query: site:x.com "AI Marketing" "thread" (Filters for value)  
  const xQuery \= \`site:x.com "${NICHE}" "thread"\`;  
  const xUrl \= \`https://www.google.com/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(xQuery)}\&tbs=qdr:w\`; // qdr:w \= Past Week  
    
  await page.goto(xUrl, { waitUntil: 'networkidle2' });  
    
  // Extract Titles & Links from Google Results  
  const xHits \= await page.evaluate(() \=\> {  
    return Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.tF2Cxc')).map((el: any) \=\> ({  
      title: el.querySelector('h3')?.innerText,  
      link: el.querySelector('a')?.href,  
      source: "X (Twitter) Viral Thread"  
    }));  
  });

  // \--- JOB 2: THE INSTAGRAM REEL WATCHER \---  
  // Strategy: Search for public Reels pages discussing your topic  
  console.log("📸 Scanning Instagram for Trends...");  
    
  const instaQuery \= \`site:instagram.com/reel "${NICHE}"\`;  
  const instaUrl \= \`https://www.google.com/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(instaQuery)}\&tbs=qdr:m\`; // qdr:m \= Past Month  
    
  await page.goto(instaUrl, { waitUntil: 'networkidle2' });  
    
  const instaHits \= await page.evaluate(() \=\> {

How to Install & Run (on IDX/GitHub)  
 \* Install the 2 tools:  
   npm install puppeteer rss-parser

 \* Run it:  
   npx tsx src/viral-radar.ts

Why this is "Better Coding" for The Council  
 \* Zero API Keys: You are not logging into X or Instagram. You are "Googling" them. It is impossible to get banned from X because you aren't even touching X's servers.  
 \* High Signal: By searching for "thread" on X, you filter out the noise and only get the educational/marketing content that goes viral.  
 \* Low Maintenance: If X changes their API tomorrow, this script still works because Google Search rarely changes.  
Next Step  
Do you want me to add the "GitHub Action" (YAML) file for this viral-radar.ts so it runs automatically every morning and saves a trends.json file for your Judge to read?
